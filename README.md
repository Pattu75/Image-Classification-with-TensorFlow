Image Classification with TensorFlow
Project Goal:

Build, train, and evaluate a neural network that recognizes hand-written digits (0â€“9) from grayscale images using the MNIST dataset.

Steps:

Understand the problem statement

Load the dataset (MNIST)

Preprocess image (unroll and normalise)

One-hot encode labels

Neural-networks refresher (math)

Create the neural network model

Compile the model

Train the model to fit the dataset

Evaluate the model

Visualize the predictions
